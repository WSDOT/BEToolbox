Introduction {#mainpage}
============
The Bridge Engineer's Toolbox (BEToolbox) application is a collection of useful bridge engineering utility programs. These programs have their origins in the earliest days of computer applications at the WSDOT Bridge Office. These applications have endured through decades of change in computing and bridge engineering technology because of their simplicity and usefulness.

The tools in the BEToolbox provide quick and easy engineering calculations. The tools described below can be used to compute geometric properties of various bridge girder types, roadway elevations, and column interaction curves.


> The names of the BEToolbox tools are shortened to conform to the seven letter character limit of the 1960's era FORTRAN programming language that was used to write the original versions of these programs.

@ref boxgdr <br>
BoxGdr computes the geometric section properties of a box girder including cross sectional area, moment of inertia, and centroid. 

@ref curvel <br>
Curvel computes roadway elevations, grade, and crown slope with respect to a given vertical curve and superelevation transition. Alignment information can be transferred between Curvel, PGSuper and PGSplice.

@ref gencomp <br>
GenComp computes the geometric section properties of a generalized composite cross section. Girder cross sections can be exported from PGSuper and PGSplice and subsequently imported into GenComp for further analysis and verification.

@ref gircomp <br>
GirComp computes the geometric section properties of a built-up or rolled steel section with a composite concrete slab.

@ref ultcol <br>
UltCol computes axial/bending interaction for a circular reinforced concrete column.
