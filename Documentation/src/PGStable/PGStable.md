PGStable {#pgstable}
=====================
PGStable performs stress and lateral stability analysis of precast prestressed girders.

PGStable uses a simple tab view user interface. The girder is defined in the Girder view. The liftng and hauling analysis parameters and results are defined on the Lifting and Hauling views, respectfully. Click on the tabs at the bottom of the window to switch between views.

> NOTE: The user interface works best if the main BridgeLink application window is maximized.

PGSuper Configuration Support
--------------------------------
PGStable will access the Project Criteria, Girder, and Haul Truck libraries from your current PGSuper Configuration. You can select a project criteria, girders, and haul truck from the library and their values will be used in the analysis.

> NOTE: Only prismatic girders library entries are available in PGStable.
