Introduction
============
This is a demonstration program that computes the St. Venant torsional constant for common precast, prestressed concrete bridge girder shapes. Computations are based on gross section properties. The finite difference method, using central differences, is used for the solution.

Operation
---------
1) Select the girder shape from the dropdown list
2) The girder section and finite difference mesh will be drawn
3) Press the [Compute] button to compute the torsional constant, J.
