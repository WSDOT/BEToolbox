St. Venant Torsional Constants
===========================================================
This is an experimental program for computing St Ventant Torsional Constants for precast prestressed bridge girders. This documentation set is created as an attempted to learn documentation with Sphinx and to use ReadTheDocs. The documentation will consist of a User Guide and Developer Documentation. Some of the documentation may not be accurate as this is just a learning experiment. While the software generally works, all of the assumptions are not enforced and error handling is minimal at best. This is not intended to be a production program at this time.
