BEToolbox SVT Extension
=======================

This is an experimental program for computing the St. Venant Torisional Constant for precast, prestressed concrete bridge girders. Calculations are carried out by the finite difference method solving Prandtl's membrane analogy.

This program has not been fully tested and is not designed for production engineering use.

This is an experimental program with the following goals:
1) Learn how to compute J using the finitie difference method and Prandlt's membrane analogy
2) Generate end user documentation using Sphinx and Read The Docs
3) Autogenerate developer documentation from C++ source files and publish them with Read the Docs
