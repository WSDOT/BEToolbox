<a NAME="PGDP"></a>PRESTRESSED GIRDER DESIGN PROGRAM</h2></center>
<a NAME="PGDP_DESCRIPTION"></a><u><b>DESCRIPTION</b>:</u>
<p>PSGDES is a program for the analysis and design of prestressed girders.
Both composite and noncomposite girders may be designed by PSGDES. Washington
State standard girder properties are coded in the program for easy input.
<p><a NAME="PGDP_DESIGN"></a><u><b>PRESTRESSED GIRDER DESIGN</b>:</u>
<p>The Prestressed Girder Design portion of the PSGDES program selects
the number and arrangement of harped and straight strands for simple span
bridges and prestressed girder bridges made continuous for live loads.
If the number of harped and straight strands are given, the program performs
a check. Girders are designed as simple spans in flexure for all girders.
See the "THEORY" section below for shear design assumptions.
<p><a NAME="PGDP_THEORY"></a><u><b>THEORY</b>:</u>
<p>In general, the program follows AASHTO Standard Specifications for Highway
Bridges dated 1989. The procedure in the program follows that which would
be used by a designer in reaching the same objective.
<p>Dead loads, live loads, and section properties are computed and used
to find girder stresses at bottom midspan. In noncomposite girders all
loads are applied to the girder. In composite girders, the girder, slab,
and diaphragm loads are applied to the girder without slab, while live
loads and continuous dead loads (curb and asphalt) are applied to the composite
girder with slab.
<p>The composite girder I is based upon the girder section and the transformed
slab.
<p>Assuming a value for eccentricity, the required number of strands at
midspan are estimated and reduced by one. This ensures that more strands
than are needed are not used. Only an even number of straight strands are
allowed for standard WSDOT girders and bulb-tees. For simple span girders
the program initially harps strands only if the estimated number of strands
required exceeds the maximum allowable number of straight strands.
<p>Strands are added if stresses at midspan are above allowable limits
or the ultimate capacity of the girder is less than Mu or 1.2Mcr. If stresses
at the end of the girder are above allowable limits, more strands are harped.
If tension at the top of the girder at harping point is above allowable
limits, the harped strands are raised through the center section of the
girder.
<p>After all minimum criteria have been met, the program tries to reduce
stresses at the end of noncomposite girders and composite girders made
continuous for live load. More straight strands are harped until any of
the following is true:
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
Stresses are compressive on the top of noncomposite girders at D/2.</li>

<li>
A change would require more strands.</li>

<li>
The maximum number of harped strands already exists.</li>

<li>
There are only four straight strands left.</li>

<li>
A change would leave more harped strands than straight strands.</li>

<li>
The hold down force at the harping point would exceed 45 kips.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
If the girder is being checked, none of these operations will take place.
<p>Office practice is to design prestressed girders as simple span, even
if the girders are made continuous for live load. All moments and shears
in the program assume simple span loading.
<p>Shear capacity is based on AASHTO 9.20. The girder web is designed to
carry all shears. Mmax and Vi are due to LL+I and added dead load (curb
and asphalt) only. Mcr is the cracking moment at the bottom of the girder.
<p>Girders made continuous for live load use a different approach at d/2,
d or the end of taper. Vi/Mmax cannot be calculated without a frame analysis.
If this value is not given, then the following is assumed:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Lspan Vi&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Lspan Vi
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
----------- = 2 when Lspan &lt;= 65 feet&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
---------- = 5 when Lspan > 65 feet
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Mmax&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Mmax
<p>The girder depth in the AASHTO shear equations is assumed to be:
<p>d = Girder Height + "A" dimension - 4.5" for composite girders.
<p>d = .8 Girder Height for noncomposite girders.
<p>However, Vu is still calculated assuming simple span. Shear calculations
at the harping point assume simple span conditions.
<p>Prestress losses at the time of release are considered to be Elastic
Shortening and 2 percent Steel Relaxation. Such that:
<p><img SRC=".\..\Pics\PSGDES1.gif" height=172 width=576>
<p><a NAME="PGDP_CONSTANT_VALUES"></a><b><u>CONSTANT VALUES USED</u></b>:
<p>Ultimate strength of slab concrete - 5.0 kips per square inch. This
value is used only to transform the slab. Positions of strands are as for
Washington State Standard Girder, filling the lowest positions first. Harped
strands are assumed to be bundled between harping points with a C.G. Height
of 3 inches above the bottom of the girder unless modified. The top pair
of harped strands is normally 2 inches below the top, except for short
girders where the rise in strands in normally 2 inches below the top, except
for short girders where the rise in strands is reduced just enough to keep
the slope of the centroid of the harped strands less than 1 in 7. That
way all of the strands are within 1 in 6.
<p>Section properties of Washington State Standard Girder Types W42G, W50G,
W58G, and W74G are stored in the program. Standard W35DG and W53DG Deck
Bulb Tee girders are also stored in the program.
<p>Standard curb load is a New Jersey barrier. If a New Jersey barrier
is used, the curb weight is .427 kips per foot. The curb is normally distributed
over three girders. The asphalt weight is added to the curb weight and
is based on .15 kips per cubic foot and the girder spacing. If asphalt
is present, the New Jersey barrier is assumed to weight .470 kips per foot.
<p>Slab dead load includes the weight of standard intermediate diaphragms,
two for spans over 80 feet, one for spans over 40 feet to 80 feet, and
none for 40 feet and below. For composite girders, a slab pad is included
over the top girder flange width with a depth equal to the difference between
"A" and the slab thickness. All concrete weights are taken as 0.16 kip
per cubic foot. End diaphragms are not included in the slab weight or end
reactions.
<p>Modulus of elasticity of steel = 28,000,000 #/sq. in.
<p>Modulus of elasticity of concrete = W<sup>(3/2)</sup> x (33) x (f'<sub>c</sub>)<sup>(1/2)</sup>
with W = 155 or E = 63,700 (f'<sub>c</sub>)<sup>(1/2)</sup>
<p>The harping point distance is taken as 0.4 x span length for girder
types W58G and W73G and all noncomposite girders, 0.333 x span length for
other types. (For nonstandard composite girders, the harping point distance,
maximum number of straight strands, and maximum number of harped strands
will default to the same values as an equivalent depth standard girder.)
Harped strands are bundled in the middle portion of the span. Spacing at
girder ends are per standard girder plans. C.G. Bundled strands are 3 inches
above bottom of girder at centerline of span for 12 strands or less. For
more than 12 strands, the excess is carried in a second bundle at 6 inches
from bottom of girder.
<p>The weight of the end block when specified is ignored for flexure design
in the program. Design stresses and shear calculations at D/2 include end
block properties when end blocks are specified. Reactions calculated by
the program include end block weight to the Centerline.

<a NAME="PGDA"></a>PRESTRESSED GIRDER DEFLECTION ANALYSIS</h2></center>
<a NAME="PGDA_DESCRIPTION"></a><u><b>DESCRIPTION</b>:</u>
<p>The deflection analysis portion of the LSGDES program computes the deflections
expected in prestressed girders. This portion of the program no longer
can be run as a separate program, it can only be run as an integrated part
of the prestressed girder design portion as described in the previous section.&nbsp;
The output, as described below, will be appended to the output for the
main PSGDES program.
<p><a NAME="PGDA_THEORY"></a><b><u>THEORY</u></b>:
<p>Composite Girders:
<blockquote>The following curve describes the deflection history of a composite
prestressed girder.</blockquote>

<center><img SRC=".\..\Pics\PSGDES2.gif" height=334 width=469></center>

<blockquote>The initial deflection (Ci) is found using traditional formulas.
Dead load deflections use:
<p><img SRC=".\..\Pics\PSGDES3.gif" height=58 width=576>
<p>Camber due to prestressing uses:
<p><img SRC=".\..\Pics\PSGDES4.gif" height=68 width=272>
<p>Where M<sub>1</sub> = prestress moment Pe at midspan
<p>M<sub>2</sub> = prestress moment Pe at girder end
<p>a = length from harping point to centerline bearing.
<p>Ci = Cps - DL girder weight
<p>This deflection is due to girder self weight and prestressing moments.
Deflections due to prestressing assumes losses of 35 ksi and 28-day concrete
strength (f’c). The modules of elasticity assumes 155 pcf for concrete
weight. After release, deflection (C(t)) is a function of time.
<p>Creep is based upon experimental data gathered from actual prestressed
girders. The formula for creep with time is:
<p>C(t) = Ci * ( 1 + ( <font face="Symbol">&AElig;</font> * .152 ln (t
+ 1 ) )
<p>where <font face="Symbol">&AElig;</font> is the total amount of additional
deflections due to creep. This value is often taken as 2.0. The maximum
value for t is 720 days.
<p>Screen camber is the deflection due to slab, diaphragm, curb, and asphalt
weights. Slab and diaphragm weights are applied to the girder only. Curb
and asphalt weights are applied to the composite girder. Field measurements
show no additional creep after pouring the slab. As with the design program,
all deflections assume simple span.</blockquote>
Noncomposite Girders:
<blockquote>Initial cambers due to prestressing and girder weight are computed
as for composite girders. Curb and asphalt weights are also applied to
the noncomposite girder. Final camber is the sum of initial cambers due
to prestressing, girder-weight, diaphragm weight, and curb weight, all
adjusted for creep.
<p>Cf = Ci (1 + <font face="Symbol">&AElig;</font>)</blockquote>

<p><a NAME="PGDA_OUTPUT"></a><b><u>OUTPUT</u></b>:
<blockquote>The upper part of the output consists of the heading and an
echo of the input or default values used by the program.
<p>For composite prestressed girders:
<blockquote><u>"D" - GIRDER CAMBER AT TIME OF SLAB POUR (XX DAYS)</u> -
<p>Girder deflection from horizontal just before the slab pour.
<p><u>DEFLECTION DUE TO SLAB WT.</u> -
<p>Instantaneous deflection to slab and diaphragm load.
<p><u>DEFLECTION DUE TO CURB + ASPH</u> -
<p>Instantaneous deflection due to curb and asphalt loads.
<p><u>SET SCREEDS FOR A TOTAL OF X.XX INCHES CAMBER ("C") ABOVE GRADE AT
C.L. SPAN -</u>
<p>This is the amount that the girder will deflect from the time the slab
pour starts until final deflection is obtained, and is the amount that
the screeds should be set above (or below) grade in order to have the final
slab elevation be equal to the grade elevation.
<p><u>FINAL CAMBER OF GIRDER</u> -
<p>Final deflection including creep of the girder above horizontal after
all dead loads have been applied.
<p><u>EXCESS GIRDER CAMBER ALLOWANCE FOR ESTABLISHING THE "A" DIMENSION
PER BRIDGE DESIGN MANUAL IS X.XX INCHES -</u>
<p>Value to be used to determine the "A" dimension. This is the girder
camber at time of slab pour less the deflection due to slab dead load.
<p><u>APPROXIMATE LIVE LOAD + IMPACT DEFL. IS X.XX INCHES</u> -
<p>The live load deflection using the input value of "Stress Bot. LL +
I" and an assumed parabolic moment distribution along the length of the
girder.</blockquote>
For noncomposite girders:
<blockquote><u>GIRDER CAMBER AT RELEASE = X.XX INCHES ABOVE THE HORIZONTAL
POSITION</u> -
<p>The initial deflection due to prestressing and girder weight.
<p><u>FINAL CAMBER OF GIRDER = X.XX INCHES ABOVE THE HORIZONTAL POSITION</u>
-
<p>The final deflection, including creep, of the girder above horizontal.
<p><u>APPROXIMATE LIVE LOAD + IMPACT DEFL. IS X.XX INCHES</u> -
<p>The live load deflection using the input value of "Stress Bot. LL +

<a NAME="PICK_POINT"></a>PICK POINT ANALYSIS</h2></center>
<a NAME="PICK_POINT_DESCRIPTION"></a><u><b>DESCRIPTION</b>:</u>
<p>The pick-point analysis portion of the PSGDES program computes the maximum
distance from center line bearing that a girder can be picked up or supported
based on stresses at the harping point. Both lifting at release and shipping
conditions are examined. Girder stresses at the harping point (point on
the girder assumed to be critical during handling) are given for maximum
pick-points and any pick-point specified.
<p><i>Note: The program does not check stresses at the pick point. For
large pick point values, the cantilever moment stress combined with the
prestressing stress can be critical at the pick point. It is the designer’s
responsibility to check this stress.</i>
<p>The program can no longer be run as a separate program, it can only
be run as an integrated part of the prestressed girder design portion as
described in the first section.&nbsp; The output, as described below, will
be appended to the output for the main PSGDES program.
<p><a NAME="PICK_POINT_THEORY"></a><b><u>THEORY</u></b>:
<p>The program solves a quadratic equation for the pick-point that produces
the maximum allowable stress at the harping point. It solves this quadratic
for allowable compression, the allowable tension without mild reinforcement,
and the allowable tension with mild reinforcement for the lifting case
and the shipping case.
<p>These pick-points are compared and the least maximum is reported in
the output along with the stresses at the harping point. Stresses at the
harping point for the specified pick-point are also specified. The maximum
pick-point will not exceed the harping point or midspan.
<p><a NAME="PICK_POINT_OUTPUT"></a><b><u>OUTPUT</u></b>:
<blockquote>The upper part of the output consists of the heading and an
echo of the input or default values used by the program.
<p><u>PICK-POINT DISTANCES (FROM CL BRG) FOR</u>: -
<p>The least maximum pick-point and the controlling condition (lifting
or shipping) are given for each allowable stress.
<p><u>STRESSES AT HARPING POINT (KSI)</u>: - From the above maximum pick-points,
the least maximum pick-point is given for the two allowable tensions and
stresses at the harping point are given. These stresses can be used to
check the mild steel required if the tension exceeds 3(f’c)<sup>1/2</sup>
or 200 psi.
<p>The program output then reminds the Engineer that the standard specs
specify some minimum pick-points. The girder should be designed so that
the maximum pick-point is above these minimums.</blockquote>
