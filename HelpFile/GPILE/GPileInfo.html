<h2>
Stiffness Analysis of a Pile Group</h2></center>

GPILE is a program that uses the stiffness method to calculate individual
pile loads in a pile group.&nbsp; The program also condenses the stiffness
of the individual piles into a 6x6 stiffness matrix that can be used in
STRUDL and SEISAB models.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
Design Methodology:</h3>

<p><br>This method is only as good as the stiffness springs given for the
piles.&nbsp; Generally, unless the deflections are very minute, pile group
response to lateral loads is not elastic.&nbsp; Enough iterations in the
design process should be used to assure that the response springs match
the loads.
<p>The first step in the analysis is to estimate the stiffness of the individual
piles. Vertical and torsional spring constants can be estimated by the
methods outlined in section 4.4.3C of the WSDOT Bridge Design Manual. The
LPile+ computer program from Ensoft Inc, is used to find the P/<font face="Symbol">d</font>, M/<font face="Symbol">q</font>,
P/<font face="Symbol">q</font>, and M/<font face="Symbol">d</font> spring constants for the two lateral axes of the pile. These
spring constants vary with the axial pile load as well as lateral forces
and moments. Close results can often be found by using a range of forces
and moments to identify a linear range.
<p>The lateral force over lateral displacement (P/<font face="Symbol">d</font>) is found by applying
a range of lateral forces to the top of the pile.&nbsp; Case 2 of LPILE+
is used to hold the pile slope constant at 0.0 at the top.&nbsp; Use a
range of axial loads to verify that P/<font face="Symbol">d</font> is not seriously affected by changes
in axial load.&nbsp; Use a range of lateral loads from very small to higher
than the expected required capacity.&nbsp; The lateral force can then be
divided by the deflection at the pile head reported by LPILE+.&nbsp; Plot
the P/<font face="Symbol">d</font> vs. deflection.&nbsp; A linear range should be apparent from the
graph, however some shaft problems did not show any linearity.&nbsp; For
the first try, use the linear value for the spring constant.&nbsp; Similarly,
the M/<font face="Symbol">d</font> can be found from the same runs.
<p>The M/<font face="Symbol">q</font> is found by using Case 4 of LPILE+.&nbsp; The pile top is held
to 0.0 dflection and a range of moments are applies.&nbsp; The pile top
rotation (<font face="Symbol">q</font>) is found by dividing the deflection at the first interval
by the interval length.&nbsp; M/<font face="Symbol">q</font> and P/<font face="Symbol">q</font> are found by dividing the applied
moment and computed shear at the pile head by the pile top rotation.&nbsp;
As with the other spring constants, there should be a linear range.
<p>After the pile springs have been estimated for all the piles, they are
input along with the pile group geometry and pile group loads.&nbsp; GPILE
then computes the group stiffness matrix for the pile group by changing
to global coordinates and summing up the individual pile stiffness matrices.
<p>The pile group matrix is inverted and multiplied by the force matrix
to solve for the foundational deflections.&nbsp; The pile cap is assumed
to be rigid and does not deform.&nbsp; The foundational displacements are
changed to pile coordinates (u, v, and w) and the individual pile forces
are computed.
<p>If pile deflections are outside the linear range, the spring constants
must be adjusted for the pile deflection and the problem rerun.&nbsp; Iterate
until satisfied with the results.
<p>As a final check, LPILE+ can be run with the individual pile loads from
GPILE.&nbsp; The pile deflections reported by both programs should be similar.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
Theory:</h3>
The program and theory are described in "Foundational Analysis and Design"
by Bowles, 3rd ed., Chapter 18-9.&nbsp; This reference should always be
read by the first time user.&nbsp; The program has been changed to better
reflect Bridge Office practice.
