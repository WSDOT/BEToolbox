   Structures Office of the Washington State Department of 
   Transportation (WSDOT) is supporting open source software concepts, 
   while including appropriate warranty and liability provisions 
   designed to protect itself from any claims relating to software 
   program output. The following excerpt from the GNU General Public 
   License is consistent with WSDOT's commitment to open source software.</FONT></FONT></P>

      licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to 
     share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is 
     intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free 
     software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This 
     General Public License applies to most of the Free Software 
     Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit 
     to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered 
     by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it 
     to your programs, too.</FONT></FONT></P>
    <P>
     <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Arial">When we speak of free software, we 
     are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are 
     designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies 
     of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you 
     receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change 
     the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you 
     know you can do these things.</FONT></FONT></P>
    <P>
     <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Arial">To protect your rights, we need to 
     make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to 
     ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to 
     certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the 
     software, or if you modify it.</FONT></FONT></P>
    <P>
     <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Arial">For example, if you distribute 
     copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give 
     the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that 
     they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them 
     these terms so they know their rights.</FONT></FONT></P>
    <P>
     <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Arial">We protect your rights with two 
     steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license 
     which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify 
     the software.</FONT></FONT></P>
    <P>
     <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Arial">Also, for each author's protection 
     and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that 
     there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is 
     modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to 
     know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems 
     introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.</FONT></FONT></P>
    <P>
     <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Arial">Finally, any free program is 
     threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the 
     danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain 
     patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent 
     this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for 
     everyone's free use or not licensed at all.</FONT></FONT></P>

   may be distributed under the terms of the Alternate Route Open Source 
   License. The &quot;Program&quot;, below, refers to any such program 
   or work. A &quot;work based on the Program&quot; means a work 
   containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with 
   modifications to either its code, or to its non-code elements (such 
   as specifications or formulas), and/or translated into another 
   language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in 
   the term &quot;modification&quot;.) A &quot;work based on the 
   Program&quot; may be the Program, Program output (independent of 
   having been made by running the Program), or any derivative work 
   under copyright law. Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.</FONT></FONT></P>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3"><B><FONT FACE="Arial">2. </FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial">Activities
    other than copying, distribution and modification are not restricted 
   by this License. The act of running the Program is not restricted, 
   unless the output from the Program includes work based on the Program 
   (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether 
   that is true depends on what the Program does. The output made by 
   running the program (i.e., bridge design or specifications) is also 
   subject to warranty, disclaimer, ASSUMPTION OF RISK, and 
   indemnification clauses, as specified below.</FONT></FONT></P>

   and indemnification clauses from this License; keep intact all 
   notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any 
   warranty; and provide any other recipients of the Program with a copy 
   of this License so that they may decide whether to use the Program 
   according to the License terms. You may charge a fee for the physical 
   act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty

   You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of

    appropriately identify a new name that allows others to easily 
    distinguish any modified version from the original version.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part 
    contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, must be 
    licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms 
    of this License. The manner of distribution must designed to provide 
    the potential user with a reasonable opportunity to review the terms

    accordance with the License terms.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when 
    run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use 
    in the most ordinary way, to display an announcement including the 
    copyright notice and notice of warranty, disclaimer, assumption of 
    risk and indemnification from this License, that users may use and 
    redistribute the program under the License conditions, and telling 
    the user how to view a copy of this License. The display should 
    include a feature that requires the potential user to acknowledge the 
    contents of the display through a mouse-click (or other key stroke) 
    before continuing through the interactive program. Notwithstanding 
    the foregoing, you may choose to provide your own warranty.</FONT></FONT></P>
   </UL>
  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3"><FONT FACE="Arial">These requirements apply to the

  <P>
   <FONT SIZE="3"><FONT FACE="Arial">separate works in themselves, then 
   this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you 
   distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same 
   sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the 
   distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose 
   permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus 
   to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.</FONT></FONT></P>

   <FONT SIZE="3"><FONT FACE="Arial">Thus, it is not the intent of this

   of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code 
   distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed

   You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program

   You are not required to accept this License, since you have not

   distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are 
   prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by 
   modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the 
   Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License and all its 
   terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the 
   Program or works based on it.</FONT></FONT></P>

   <FONT SIZE="3"><STRONG><FONT FACE="Arial">10.</FONT></STRONG><FONT FACE="Arial"> 
   Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the

   conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or 
   otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do 
   not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot 
   distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under 
   this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a 
   consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, 
   if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of 
   the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly 
   through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this 
   License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.</FONT></FONT></P>
