   The goal of the BEToolbox&#153; project is to quickly and 
   resourcefully bring together our legacy applications into an easy to 
   use and convenient tool without re-writing the software. We recognize 
   that many of these legacy tools should be completely re-written from 
   the ground up. That will come later.</P>
  <P>
   When we had these programs running on our VAX system, they were 
   difficult to access and the documentation was difficult to find. It 
   was extremely difficult to share these programs with anyone outside 
   of WSDOT. The programs were a pain to use because they required you 
   to jump around between the operating system, text editors, and the 
   program. Creating input files was always a chore because you had to 
   first find the coding form and then type the data into some cryptic 
   file format.</P>
  <P>
   The BEToolbox&#153; is a great compromise between the need to 
   completely re-write these legacy applications and the need to find a 
   quick and inexpensive means to make them readily accessible for 
   production use.</P>
