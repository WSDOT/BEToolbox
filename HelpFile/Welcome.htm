<p>The goal of the BEToolbox™ project is to quickly and resourcefully bring 
 together our legacy applications into an easy to use and convenient tool 
 without re-writing the software. We recognize that many of these legacy 
 tools should be completely re-written from the ground up. That will come 
 later.</p>

<p>When we had these programs running on our VAX system, they were difficult 
 to access and the documentation was difficult to find. It was extremely 
 difficult to share these programs with anyone outside of WSDOT. The programs 
 were a pain to use because they required you to jump around between the 
 operating system, text editors, and the program. Creating input files 
 was always a chore because you had to first find the coding form and then 
 type the data into some cryptic file format.</p>

<p>The BEToolbox™ is a great compromise between the need to completely 
 re-write these legacy applications and the need to find a quick and inexpensive 
 means to make them readily accessible for production use.</p>
