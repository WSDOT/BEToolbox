   QConLE computes the response of continuous bridge 
   superstructures that can be modeled using the AASHTO simplified 
   method. This&nbsp;program computes responses for dead loads, HL-93 
   live loads, and selected LRFD limit states along a continuous or simply-supported&nbsp;superstructure.
    Stiffness properties, distribution factors, and dead&nbsp;loads are 
   entered on a per-span basis.<BR>

<H2>Envelope Simple and Continuous Behavior</H2>
<P>The input option to "Envelope Simple and Continuous Behavior" allows you to run 
two two-Stage models simultaneously and compute the envelope of the results for 
these two models. The first model is a two-stage model with simple support conditions 
(span hinges at all piers)&nbsp;at all supports for both stages. The 
second model has simple support conditions for the first stage, but is made 
continuous over internal piers in the second stage. This option is only available 
for two-stage, multi-span, simple/continuous structure types.</P>
<P>            
 This option is used in QConLE to support WSDOT simple/continuous envelope 
design policy for precast girder structures.</P>

<H2>Layout of Negative Moment Distribution Factors</H2>
  <P>
   Examination of Section 4.6.2.2 of the LRFD 
   Specifications shows that&nbsp;the span length used to compute 
   distribution factors for negative moment is computed differently 
   depending on the location in the span where&nbsp;the&nbsp;results are 
   to be computed. This span length changes depending on whether a 
   location is near an interior support (e.g., between points of 
   contraflexure), or in a location outside of this range (in span). 
   Although QCon LE does not compute distribution factors, it must 
   provide the capability to support this specification requirement. 
   Therefore, the program&nbsp;has input for&nbsp;negative moment 
   distribution factors for both of these regions.</P>
  <P>
   In general, support distribution factors are 
   used&nbsp;between points of contraflexure, unless the span in 
   question&nbsp;has no point of contraflexure - then the mid-span is 
   used. Span distribution factors are used in all other regions. The 
   figure below demonstrates how these distribution factors are laid out 
   along a span for a variety of conditions:</P>
