<h2>GirComp Program</h2></center>
GIRCOMP is a program that calculates the section properties
of a composite girder with either a rolled or built-up steel section.
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<h3>Input:</h3>
For a rolled steel section, please use the "Rolled
GirComp" version of this program.&nbsp; For a built-up steel section, please
use the "Built-Up GirComp" version of this program.&nbsp; This information
file applies to both versions of the program.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a rolled section, the numbers input are the
area, depth, and moment of inertia of the section and any number of lines
with a concrete slab width, thickness, G distance (between the section
top and slab bottom) and three values of N (the modular ratio = (E)steel/(E)concrete).
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a built-up section you may input any number
of lines that include the built-up beam web depth and thickness, top flange
width and thickness, bottom flange width and thickness, the concrete slab
width, thickness, and G distance and three values of N.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You may enter only one rolled beam and any number
of slab properties or any number of lines of built-up beam and slab properties
per program run.&nbsp; You may not combine rolled and built-up sections
in the same run.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The program uses standard engineering formulas to
calculate the section properties.&nbsp; The input data is print out and
also the built-up girder I, S bottom and top, Y bottom and top and Q of
the bottom and top flange and the area.&nbsp; The composite properties
output are for the built-up girder, the I, S bottom and top, Y bottom and
top and Q of the bottom flange, slab and slab + top flange.&nbsp; The properties
output are the same for the rolled beam except that only the slab is output.
